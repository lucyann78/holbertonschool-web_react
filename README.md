TypeScript Learning Objectives Project
Overview
This project is designed to help you master the fundamental concepts of TypeScript. By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain key TypeScript concepts without needing to reference external resources.

Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of this project, you will be able to:

Basic Types in TypeScript:

Understand and utilize the basic data types in TypeScript, including string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and any.
Interfaces, Classes, and Functions:

Define and implement interfaces to enforce structure within your applications.
Create and utilize classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
Write functions that leverage TypeScript's type system for better type safety.
Working with the DOM and TypeScript:

Manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using TypeScript, enhancing interactivity in web applications.
Understand type assertions and how to effectively work with DOM elements.
Generic Types:

Implement generic types to create reusable components that work with various data types while maintaining type safety.
Using Namespaces:

Organize your TypeScript code using namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and improve code maintainability.
Merging Declarations:

Understand how to merge declarations in TypeScript to extend existing types and interfaces.
Using an Ambient Namespace to Import an External Library:

Import and use external libraries in your TypeScript projects through ambient namespaces, enhancing functionality without losing type safety.
Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript:

Grasp the concept of nominal typing in TypeScript and how it differs from structural typing, allowing for more precise type definitions.
